After about a year and half of having very little time to spend on development,
we have finally been able to put our heads down and get some work out.
The first results are already visible, the new website, as well as the [Interactive Demo](/rddtools/demo).
Matthieu has also been busy adding new issues to the tracker, that will hopefully be fixed soon,
as well as the implementation of some new methods.

We also had a [bugfix](https://github.com/bquast/rddtools/commit/f28e97504519521571ff5d636898aeb21e6c84f8) by [Paul Testa](https://sites.google.com/site/paultesta/) (for which, thanks),
which has already made its way to [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rddtools).

Lastly, we are considering renaming the package (though not the functions) to RDDtools, would this be more informative to new users?
As of yet, we do not have a commenting system here, so if you have an opinion on this, please drop me a line on one of the platforms on the right.
